# Create-a-Random-Joke-using-React-app-through-API
A website that fetches data (joke) from an external API and displays it on the screen. Weâ€™ll be using React completely to base this website. Each time we reload the page and click the button, a new joke fetched and rendered on the screen by React. As we are using React for this project, we need not reload the page to display the fetched data.
